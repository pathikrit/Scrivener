Scrivener is a simple log/stat aggregation framework inspired from Facebook's Scribe project:

Issues addressed:
1) Asynchronous Logging - Light-weight messages are put in a blockingqueue on the client-side and a separate consumer-thread pulls them out from the queue and sends to server. Blazingly fast logging.
2) Distributed Logging - A single server sees all log/stat messages. Makes corelation easier
3) Stat Framework - Easy stat framework. A simple method stat(key,num). If you want to keep counters, simply call stat(key,1).
4) Integrated Viewer - A web based log/statistics viewer

Client:
A simple Java client - S4JLogger.java has 5 essential public static methods:
a) config(appId, server) - Call at the entry point of your app with appId and Scrivener server
b) debug/warn/error - Simple static methods that uses reflection (in separate thread) to figure out filename and line number etc
c) stat - Takes in key and a number. Visualizations are auto generated on server side

Server:
A simple nodejs server backed by couchdb that accepts log/stat messages

Viewer:
The same nodejs server serves a single page web app for log/stat visualization
